# X3DH_with_an_error_C-

I am trying to create a key generation manager that is designed for X3HD. I used the Qt Creator IDE, the MinGW 
compiler and OpenSSL. If you decide to run the wrong code, then run it in main.cpp, not mainGitHub.cpp. I also 
implemented tests (test.cpp that work correctly, and this is what confuses me the most. The code looks awkward, 
but I thought "Ctrl + F" would help to search for functions. The code implementation is described in the 
X3DH_manager_with_one_error_extented files in three languages.
